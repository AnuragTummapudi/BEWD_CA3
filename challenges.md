# Challenges Faced:
1. **Data Validation**: Ensuring that all required fields are provided and correctly formatted (e.g., tags as an array, difficulty level validation).
2. **Authorization Logic**: Implementing checks to ensure that only the owner of a recipe can update or delete it, preventing unauthorized modifications.
3. **Duplicate Recipe Prevention**: Adding logic to prevent users from submitting duplicate recipes with the same title.
